# Pagination Challenge
This is a simple web page made as a challenge, to play around with pagination.
In this case my focus was on rendering the pagination numbers as requested,
using the variables I've been given.

These variables are:


current_page = Page the user is currently located at  
total_pages = Total amount of pages  
boundaries = Amount of page numbers allowed in the beggining / end of the pagination  
around = Amount of page numbers allowed around the current_page  

I've added another variable so we could play around with the script / app:


page_size = Amount of items to be populated in each page

In this case I simply populate each page accordingly to the page_size.
